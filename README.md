# Featured
This library will help you to split activity or fragment code into truly decoupled, testable and maintainable features.

Features are small units sharing same lifecycle. They are hosted by a `FeatureHost` class which, in turn, resides in an activity or a fragment. Features communicate to each other through the feature host by means of events as shown in the diagram below.
